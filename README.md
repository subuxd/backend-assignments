# Assignment 1
1. Spin up a Node.js driven Server (on port 3000).
2. Handle two routes: '/' and '/users'.
   - Return some greeting text on the '/' route.
   - Return a list of dummy users on the '/users' route.
3. Add a form with a text input for the "username" on the '/' page and submit a POST request to '/create-user' upon a button click.
4. Add the '/create-user' route and parse the incoming data (i.e. the username) and simply log it to the console.
